# Data-Science-Task

Welcome to my Data Science, Data Analysis, and AI Projects repository! ðŸŽ“ Here, I've compiled a collection of tasks and exercises that I've completed as part of my journey in mastering data science and artificial intelligence. The repository covers various aspects, including data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning.  

These projects leverage popular Python libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, among others. Each project is accompanied by well-documented code, insights, and visualizations, providing a comprehensive view of the methodologies and techniques applied.  

Feel free to explore, learn, and give me suggessions to improve my knowledge! ðŸš€
